# puzzle
A simple implementation of the HTML5 Canvas in the creation of a Puzzle game

## Requirements
To use the Puzzle game, you need PHP >= 5.x.x

## Usage
#### Adding images to the Puzzle engine
To add more images to the preexisting (default) images of the game, simply visit the /play/assets/img/ folder in the files and upload more images there (there are five default images there already).
#### Launching and playing the game
Start a local server using Laragon, WAMP or any other means and visit the /puzzle/ directory in your browser. There, you can view images and begin playing the puzzle game right there.

## Contribution
The project is open to contributions from anyone. Just hit me right up... ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
